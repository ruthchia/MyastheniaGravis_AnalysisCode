Code for each analysis are deposited as individual notebooks in the following folders. Each folder might contain more than one notebook as some analyses were performed per cohort followed by meta analysis.

`01.` QC of genotype data and imputation

`02.` Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS)
      
`03.` Transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS)
    
`04.` HLA fine mapping & genotype correlation
       
`05.` Genetic correlation using LDSC

`06.` Priority index analysis
